            <h2>15. No Waiver</h2>

            <p>No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and ToolNest's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
